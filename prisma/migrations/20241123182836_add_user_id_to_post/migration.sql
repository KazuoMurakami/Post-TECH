/*
  Warnings:

  - You are about to drop the `Category` table. If the table is not empty, all the data it contains will be lost.
  - The primary key for the `Post` table will be changed. If it partially fails, the table could be left without primary key constraint.
  - You are about to drop the column `authorId` on the `Post` table. All the data in the column will be lost.
  - You are about to drop the column `published` on the `Post` table. All the data in the column will be lost.
  - Added the required column `userId` to the `Post` table without a default value. This is not possible if the table is not empty.
  - Made the column `content` on table `Post` required. This step will fail if there are existing NULL values in that column.
